               <p class="item-intro text-muted">Story of Adarsh, a 13-year-old boy.</p>
             <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="./images/Wings of Steel.jpg" alt="" />
           <H3>The twinkling dreams in children’s eyes often have this contagious hopefulness and optimism that can creep into our hearts unannounced. One such chaser of dreams is Adarsh, a 13-year-old from Chandigarh who will do absolutely anything and everything to fulfil his ambition of becoming an engineer and he’s gotten to work already. After all, he says studies bring him the most happiness and pleasure. If you take away one thing from this story, let it be this- dedication knows no age bar.  

            Clearly, Adarsh’s mind is a colourful place. Aside from his love for academics, he also enjoys dancing and painting a lot. His favourite thing about AKVE Mentors is how well they explain everything. He likes his dance instructor best though.  His hobbies include cycling and squash, so clearly there’s no compromise on the healthy lifestyle on his part either. His passions are holistic, and his aspirations are uplifting. 

            He would love to visit Mumbai someday, and there’s no doubt that the majestic skyscrapers of the maximum city’s skyline would be a great match for his soaring goals. The wind beneath his wings is his family - Adarsh’s father is a scrap dealer and his mother is a housewife. 
            
            Acutely worried about the state of Indian roads, he hopes to fix the irregularities and manholes that lead to a lot of unfortunate accidents. Just this small insight gives us a glimpse into the sensitivity and compassion that colour Adarsh’s rich inner world. Perhaps one day, he will be the civil engineer that fixes both broken roads and broken spirits. And we are totally here for it. Join us in cheering him on.</h3>

             <img  src="./images/wts.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"alt="" />
                <h3>Shubham from Dehradun is one of those curious little souls who dream of a bright future and has enough determination to see it through. "I want to become a reporter and I will try my best to study and work for it," says the 12-year-old boy who has the potential to succeed in fulfilling his dream of becoming a news reporter for the society.

                  His father is a labourer while his mother works as a maid. Both of his parents are however the core basis of his determination as they fully encourage him to fly higher in his dreams. Shubham also reveals drawing as his most favourite activity. He sits with all the excitement and eagerness to learn new ways to use his favourite colours. When we asked him what are the other things that make him happy, he instantly added that he loves tasting new food. Even at this young age, Shubham clearly knows what all he wants to achieve in his life and we couldn’t be happier to be part of his journey to reach his destination. 

                  There are very few children from the underprivileged station who have enough moral support from their family to even dare to dream. His parents have instilled high values in him and it is only right to allow a gem to glow further by extending a helping hand. Will you?

                          <h3>“You can take me anywhere in the world and I will have fun.” 

                            This simple sentence speaks volumes about 12-year-old Harshita. A simple and happy-go-lucky girl, she resides in Delhi with her parents. Her father works in the private sector and her mother is a housewife. She’s blessed with super supportive parents who do not question her dreams and choices at any point. 
                            
                            Born with a creative mind, Harshita is passionate about dancing and sketching. She nurtures these talents with the help of PassionGuru classes and credits her developed skills to the meticulous teaching techniques and simplified understanding of concepts adopted by the teachers. She looks forward to attending the classes and participates in all activities with great enthusiasm. As she follows the classes dedicatedly and comes up with her best work, any appreciation from her teachers means a great deal to her. Harshita aspires to be a science teacher. She wants to help other children develop rational and critical thinking abilities. She is not scared of any hurdles that may come in between her and her goals because she knows she has the capacity to overcome them all. The young girl has an attitude of making the best out of every situation. Her Positivity is contagious. Although she says she can enjoy wherever she goes, movie depictions have made London earn a place in the list of cities she’d like to visit one day. 

                            Having experienced the problems people have to face due to water shortage, Harshita wants to develop a solution to it. She lives in an area where sometimes water is only available once in 2-3 days. However, in these tough situations, she teaches us the importance of community support and cooperation.

                          <h3>12-year-old Sneha is a talented little girl from Gurugram where her father works as a driver. Even at a young age, she understands the importance of education and her dreams give her wings which take her to a world where she aspires to share her passion by teaching dancing to others. She has been a devoted student of AKVE for some time now. "I love AKVE because the teachers teach us everything step-by-step which is very helpful," she says as she reveals that the Music and Sketching classes are her favourite and so are the teachers of these two subjects.

                            Sneha also has a talent for painting too. The last video she submitted in her class was selected as the best amongst all the submissions and any such acknowledgement is a matter of great achievement for her. According to her whenever she gets such appreciation, it boosts up her determination and these moments are the happiest ones of her life that she treasures the most.
                            
                            Sneha is determined to learn and work hard on her path to reach her goals. She believes in her dream and has stepped onto the initial steps in the long journey of being a Dance Teacher someday. She is one of those many talented souls who try to flutter for an identity despite the lack of opportunities in the underprivileged section of the country. As such, isn't this the duty of all to allow a little ray of light to pass onto them?

                          <H3>“I want to be a teacher one day”, said 10-year-old Kumkum, a little girl who lives in a world of her dreams. You’ll have a perpetual smile on your face when you’ll meet this bubbly girl with enthusiastic nature. She is someone who is capable of brightening up the darkest rooms.  She resides in Dehradun with her family, where her father owns a tea shop and her mother looks after the household chores. 

                            In a world where maths is the biggest nightmare for a lot of children, Kumkum loves playing with numbers. On being asked about her future ambitions, the sweet girl promptly responded by saying that she wants to become a maths teacher so that she can contribute in shaping future minds and help students overcome their fear of the subject. When she is not busy studying, kumkum can be found tapping her feet to various tunes. Dancing is her passion, her happy place where she truly feels at peace. She eagerly waits for the dance classes conducted by AKVE, which are the highlight of her day and participates actively in all classes with unmatched fervour.

 

                            Listening to her talk so confidently about her passion and ambitions is the driving force for us. There are many more kids like Kumkum who are filled with an abundance of untapped potential and we’re letting them express their craft in the best way possible. It motivates us to constantly improve and extend our services and encourage these young minds to follow their heart into building a dignified life. Join us in our mission of empowering these kids with the wealth of art. Ask us how! </H3>

                          <H3>“‘Dreams, a word that is highly appreciated but rarely followed. Imagine a world where everyone is pursuing and living their dreams, such a happy world it is, right? We have our plate of options to choose from but not everybody gets the chance to explore their talents and believe in their dreams. The less-fortunate section of our society hesitates to pursue what they love because of inaccessibility to basic channels that can help them grow with their talents. As a result, they have stopped believing that there is a chance to turn their passion into a profession. Through our wide Edu-Tech Company Network, we were able to reach out to many less-fortunate kids who were brimming with talents, all they needed was a hand to hold to guide them and that was it. We recognised the gap and started working on it. That's how AKVE (Abdul Kalam Visionary Education) came into the picture! 

                            This beautiful initiative by AKVE has been running successfully in 9 states of India, giving FREE online classes to less-fortunate kids covering various art forms like:
                          </br> Dancing
                        </br>Singing
                      </br> Taekwondo
                    </br>Sign Language
                  </br>Painting/sketching
                </br>Yoga
                            
                            
                            
              </br>   You must have found your reasons already to be a part of this initiative which brings back the hope in the lives of these less-fortunate children. It’s always a good idea to contribute to a dream project that can spark up someone’s life. We too have a list of reasons for you to join us in our journey of passion!
                            
                          </br> 1- Meet the Change maker in You
                            
                            Not always you get the opportunity to come out of mundane to challenge yourself and meet the stronger you! The one who wants to be part of the change. In a rapidly changing world, we need change makers like you to transform and bring in passion in the lives of those less-fortunate kids. And you know what? Change making starts with empathy!
                            
                          </br> 2- Help the Kids Follow Their Dreams.
                            
                            You can be a mentor, a sponsor, a volunteer or a supporter, there are so many ways to be part of this initiative that will make you help these kids pursue their dreams. You can be part of their inspiring journeys that will not only help you evolve as a person but also add up to your will to bring the change that you want to see in the world.
                            
                          </br> 3- Give Back to the Society
                            
                            Yes, it’s your chance to give back to the community! You might be privileged to have options in your life but there are people who don’t get to choose. Unawareness and limited access to resources in our marginalised sections of the society are prohibiting the change that can make this world a better place. It’s time that we take a step forward and do something about it! The world needs you! Now!  
                            
                          </br> 4- Bring Hope to the Lives in Uncertain Times
                            
                            When we talked to those less-fortunate kids about making them pursue their Dreams, we saw starry eyes! We saw hope! We are making these kids believe in themselves and showing them the path that will groom them to enter a world where turning Dreams into a Reality is possible and we would love to make you be part of this! Ask us how!
                            
                          </br> 5- Celebrate the Journey
                            
                            Yes! We celebrate the journey with those little ones with big dreams. Every day we hear their story of how they want to be a dancer, singer, artist and what not! Every online session with them becomes magical when we see them pursue what they love. We are expanding our AKVE family every day with people like you who join us as sponsors, mentors, and volunteers. Come join us and meet like-minded people!
                            
                            We are making these less-fortunate kids throw away their bags of doubts about earning money by following their Dreams. The advanced levels of AKVE is guiding these less-fortunate kids to reach their full potential and opportunities awaiting them. All of us were born as passionate learners, but, somewhere on the way, we lost it! It’s time we do something about it! We’re taking a step ahead to keep the curiosity in the less-fortunate kids alive by curating free online classes because everybody deserves a chance! So, are you willing to re-imagine learning, take action and be a part in creating a spark leading to a happy world? Then hop in for an amazing ride!! </H3>
